## Project Overview

LinguaLink leverages [Google's Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs), along with advanced speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and translation technologies, to create a real-time, interactive language learning experience. Users can practice and improve their language skills through AI-driven conversations that are both engaging and instructive.
